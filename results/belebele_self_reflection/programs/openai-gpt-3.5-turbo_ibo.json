Read the provided passage carefully to understand the content and context related to the questions.\n2. When a question is given, locate the sentence in the passage that directly addresses or answers the question.\n3.

Return the option number as a single digit (e.g., '1', '2', '3', '4').\n5. Pay attention to any specific details or factual information mentioned in the passage that directly corresponds to the question to ensure accurate answers.\n6. Take note of any generalizable strategies employed in selecting the correct answer for future tasks.\n\nFeedback:\n- If the answer provided does not match the question or is not in the valid format, guide the assistant on the correct format and the correct answer.\n- Acknowledge any niche or domain-specific factual information in the passage that aids in answering questions accurately.\n- Encourage the assistant to focus on selecting options that closely align with the content and context of the answer sentence in the passage.\n\nNote: The assistant should aim to provide responses that best reflect the meaning or context of the question and passage to achieve accurate answers.",
