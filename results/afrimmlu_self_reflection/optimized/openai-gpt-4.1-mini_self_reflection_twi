Alternatively \"to\u0254 ka ho\" is a phrase meaning \"including addition,\" thus $6 is each item's price including all charges.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 934 \u00d7 6 = $5604.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n[1] $5,434\n\n[2] $5,484\n\n[3] $5,604\n\n[4] $5,684\n\n$5,604 matches the straightforward multiplication and the proper total cost.", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 1}, {"question": "W\u0254 ntwahoyia nkyeky\u0511mu mu no, nsusu\u0511 b\u0511n na \u0511w\u0254 h\u0254 ma angle a \u0511ne kanko ho 1/360 di ns\u0511?", "subject": "elementary_mathematics", "choices": ["1", "90", "180", "360"], "example_answer": "A", "reasoning": "The question asks about angle measurement in the division of a circle, where an angle corresponding to \"1/360\" of a complete turn is being considered.

Options related to politics or human rights usually exist in multiple languages, often in official state languages or international languages.\n\nHence, the most fitting answer, which aligns with the necessity of having cultural documents in the primary language, is \"Amammer\u025b mu ky\u025bfa\" (Cultural division).", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 0}, {"question": "D\u025bn ne amanaman ntam mmara a 'w\u0254akyeky\u025b mu' no ho as\u025bm no?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["S\u025b y\u025bka amanaman ntam mmara a \"\u025bt\u0254 apaawa\" ho as\u025bm a, \u025bkyer\u025b s\u025b mmara nhyehy\u025be ahorow betumi de amanaman ntam mmara koro no ara adi dwuma.", "Mmara ahorow a \u025bsono, te s\u025b ananafo ahode mmara ne nnipa ahofadi mmara, betumi afi ase w\u0254 \u0254kwan soronko so.

The options refer to the principle of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) under the \"Ahobamm\u0254 Bagua,\" which in Akan refers to the Security Council as the authorized body maintaining peace and security. The core of international law regarding enforcement powers is that if the UNSC does not authorize the use of force or intervention, then states are obliged not to use armed force, except in self-defense.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n1. Suggests that if a state is warned, it is assumed the Security Council agrees with using armed force, which is not accurate; the council must explicitly authorize force.\n2. Claims that if some UNSC members authorize, it counts as good or valid, which ignores the collective authorization necessary.\n3. States that if permission to intervene is not given, then the Security Council will still allow states to use force against them is incorrect; it suggests a contradiction.\n4. States that if multiple resolutions that do not permit action are passed, the Security Council will have neighboring nations take measures they consider effective in resolving the issue\u2014this reflects the recognized role of the UNSC in authorizing collective measures by member states or regional arrangements.\n\nOption 4 aligns best with the legal role of the Security Council to authorize collective action when threats or breaches to peace occur.

Customary international law requires two essential elements: state practice and opinio juris (the belief that such practice is carried out from a sense of legal obligation).

Internally, this question relates to international law's regulation of the use of force before 1945. Historically, before the UN Charter came into force in 1945, there was no firm international prohibition on the use of force; states often acted according to their own interests without a universally binding legal framework restricting force. Therefore, before 1945, the \"use of force\" was generally not forbidden by international law in the way it is after the UN Charter.

Option 1 states that the ECHR's authority prevails over human rights violations committed by member states, implying the ECHR\u2019s ruling supersedes those violations in international law.\n2. Option 2 mentions the ECHR\u2019s authority retreating behind the territory of a state involved in a conflict, which is inaccurate as the ECHR\u2019s jurisdiction extends over member states regardless of conflict.\n3. Option 3 says ECHR\u2019s authority recedes compared to its structure when a member state deploys troops in UN peacekeeping, which is unrelated to human rights enforcement under the ECHR.\n4. Option 4 states that the ECHR covers human rights violations occurring in states that were formerly members on territories they once controlled.\n\nThe correctly aligned fact is that the ECHR's jurisdiction and authority primarily apply within the territories of its member states and it ensures protection of human rights against violations by those states during their membership. After a state ceases to be a member, or in extraterritorial actions, the ECHR may have limited or no authority.\n\nTherefore, option 1 accurately captures the principle that the ECHR\u2019s power overrides states\u2019 human rights violations while they are members of the ECHR system.

Claims that with international law, it does not matter if there is no English law governing international organizations.\n\nThe correct rationale, based on international law principles, is that in cases involving international organizations or treaties, the organization's or treaty's foundational documents (treaties) create the applicable law. The absence of a domestic (e.g., English) law does not prevent the international treaty or organization from having authority or law.

The correct interpretation typically involves understanding how treaties become binding, i.e., their incorporation into a state's legal system or their legal effect within the state's law.\n\nOption [1] says treaties must be converted into domestic law via legislation before they can be enforced internally. This corresponds to the \"dualism\" theory of treaty incorporation, common in many legal systems, where international treaties do not automatically have domestic legal effect without local legislation. \n\nOption [2] suggests it is unnecessary to create new domestic legislation for bodies created under treaties \u2014 which reduces the emphasis on domestic incorporation, which is generally not correct as treaties need proper implementation.\n\nOption [3] indicates treaties are viewed as subordinate to domestic law (\"W\u0254hw\u025b apam ahorow no so s\u025b nea w\u0254hy\u025b \u0254man no mmara ase\" - that treaties are under domestic law), which is contrary to international law principles where treaties have international binding effect regardless of domestic law hierarchy, though their domestic enforceability may depend on local law.\n\nOption [4] refers to the moment when ratifying a treaty it becomes part of domestic law (\"w\u0254dan emu mmara fa\"), which aligns with a monist approach where treaties automatically become part of domestic law upon ratification.\n\nConsidering the general common understanding in international law doctrine of treaties, especially in contexts that use dualism (common in many states), Option [1] best captures the established teaching that treaties require domestic legislative incorporation before becoming enforceable law internally.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [1].", "pred_answer": "A", "method": 0}, {"question": "So \u025bs\u025b s\u025b w\u0254n a w\u0254p\u0511 s\u0511 wodi atet\u0511m a ICJ de ato dwa no so?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["Dabi, s\u025bnea mmara no kyer\u025b no, \u025bns\u025b s\u025b w\u0254n a w\u0254s\u0254re tia mmara no di so.", "Dabi, gye s\u025b nnipa baanu no adi kan ay\u025b ho nhyehy\u025be.", "S\u025b nhyehy\u025be a w\u0254b\u025by\u025b no bere tiaa bi no b\u025bda adi a, egyina K\u0254\u0254to no gyinaesi so.", "Aane, As\u025bnnibea no asi gyinae bere nyinaa s\u025b w\u0254hy\u025b mmara a \u025bw\u0254 La Grand as\u025bm (2001) mu."], "example_answer": "D", "reasoning": "The question concerns who must comply with the customary international law decisions made by the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

Option [2] suggests only two persons who make an agreement are bound, which misinterprets customary international law as requiring prior treaty arrangements. Option [3] refers vaguely to temporary agreements and ICJ standing, but customary law is binding beyond temporary agreements and depends on state practice and acceptance. Option [4] asserts that the ICJ standing established in LaGrand case (2001) confirms the binding nature of law.\n\nThe LaGrand case clarified the binding effect of certain international legal obligations on states. The ICJ rulings on customary international law are binding on the parties involved and reflected in consistent state practice under opinio juris, which the LaGrand case addressed in its affirmation of binding legal standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct understanding is that the ICJ has consistently held that customary international law decisions are binding, as established in La Grand (2001).

This is a legal principle established by Nuremberg, meaning the defense of following orders is not a sufficient excuse.\n\nAll the options except option 4 accurately represent the realities or legal principles established by the war crimes tribunals. Option 4 is somewhat ambiguously worded but essentially correct; it states that superior authority cannot excuse war crimes. This principle was established.\n\nHowever, the key is the phrasing of option 4: \"tumi a \u025bkor\u0254n a w\u0254de ma obi no ntumi ny\u025b \u0254ko b\u0254ne anaa amum\u0254y\u025b\" meaning \"the superior power given to someone cannot allow them to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity\". But in international law, superior orders do NOT exempt criminal responsibility\u2014this is known. So option 4 is actually correct.\n\nSince all statements appear factually correct, the question asks which is NOT true. Re-examining option 2: It says the war crimes tribunals \"de ns\u025bmm\u0254nedi foforo sii h\u0254 a w\u0254fr\u025b no 'b\u0254ne a w\u0254de tia adesamma',\" meaning \"established a new crime called 'crime against humanity'.\"\n\nBut the term \"crimes against humanity\" did exist before the tribunals, though the tribunals substantially developed it as a legal concept. It was first broadly codified and used in the tribunals.\n\nHence, is the tribunal the originator of the crime against humanity or was it pre-existing?\n\nIn international law, the concept existed but was first defined and applied in a legal context at the Nuremberg Trials.\n\nTherefore, option 2 is true.\n\nOption 4's second half \"tumi a \u025bkor\u0254n a w\u0254de ma obi no ntumi ny\u025b \u0254ko b\u0254ne...\" literally says \"superior power given to someone cannot commit war crimes...\" which is a misstatement; it is the person who commits the crime, but the law says that superior orders are not a defense.\n\nSo the statement likely misrepresents that superior power cannot commit crimes, instead the trials established that the exercise of superior orders is not an excuse. The wording in option 4 seems misleading and incorrect.\n\nThus, option 4 is the false statement.", "pred_answer": "D", "method": 0}, {"question": "\u0186man b\u025bn na \u025bw\u0254 tumi w\u0254 po so ahy\u025bn so w\u0254 amanaman ntam nsu mu?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["\u0186man biara betumi de ne mmara adi dwuma w\u0254 amanaman asub\u0254nten mu.", "Aman betumi de w\u0254n mmara adi dwuma w\u0254 ananafo ahy\u025bn so w\u0254 amanaman ntam nsu mu bere a ns\u025bmm\u0254nedi ho ns\u025bm a \u025bfa w\u0254n ho w\u0254 h\u0254 no.", "\u0186man a po so hy\u025bn hy\u025b n'ahy\u025bn ase no nkutoo na \u0254w\u0254 tumi w\u0254 po so hy\u025bn no so w\u0254 amanaman ntam nsu mu, gye tebea horow bi te s\u025b po so akwantu mu.", "\u0186man a ahy\u025bn hy\u025b n'ahy\u025bn no frankaa so no nkutoo na \u0254w\u0254 tumi w\u0254 n'ahy\u025bn no so w\u0254 amanaman ntam nsu mu a anny\u025b biara."], "example_answer": "C", "reasoning": "Question asks which state has jurisdiction or authority over ships on the high seas under international law.

Although it says the price is not always rigid, which contradicts original, the question claims \"If perfectly inelastic, its price is very rigid.\" So the matching option should affirm that rigidity.\n\nSince none of the options perfectly restate that, but [1] contradicts it, and the others do not address that point well.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A (option 1) because it is a direct contradiction that forces the knowledge that perfect inelasticity leads to price rigidity, so the correct matching is that the price is rigid, and option 1 denies that.\n\nHence the correct answer is A.", "pred_answer": "A", "method": 0}, {"question": "De\u025b edi so\u0254 yi mu b\u025bn na \u025bnny\u025b su a \u025bfa \u0254p\u025b nkoae\u025b a at\u0254 sima ho?", "subject": "high_school_microeconomics", "choices": ["\u0190ka a w\u0254b\u0254 no bere tenten bi a w\u0254b\u0254 bere a w\u0254duu MR = MC no.", "P < MC.", "akansie a \u025bk\u0254 so w\u0254 akansifo ntam.", "\u0190ka a kyea"], "example_answer": "B", "reasoning": "The question asks which of the given options is NOT characteristic of a monopoly (\u0254p\u025b nkoae\u025b a at\u0254 sima).

Thus, option [2] is the correct answer.", "pred_answer": "B", "method": 1}, {"question": "S\u0511 wode toto dwadie akansie ho a, nnipa dodo\u0254 dwadie y\u0511", "subject": "high_school_microeconomics", "choices": ["Mfaso\u0254 biara nni so na tua ho ka bebree.", "ma nnipa dodow a \u025bte saa adwuma nanso akatua a \u025bw\u0254 h\u0254 sua.", "akatua d\u0254\u0254so na w\u0254de w\u0254n ho hy\u025b adwuma no mu.", "akatua so te ne te adwumay\u025bfo\u0254 so"], "example_answer": "D", "reasoning": "The question asks about the typical characteristic of a labor-intensive production when labor is the main input.

This is a microeconomics question concerning labor supply and labor force participation.\n\nIf someone who is completely committed to working replaces someone who refrains from working or works very little, the overall labor force (the number of people working or willing to work) will increase.\n\nOption analysis:\n[1] \"W\u0254n baanu nyinaa b\u025bd\u0254\u0254so.\" means both will increase. This is ambiguous and does not answer the direct question about labor supply change.\n[2] \"W\u0254n baanu nyinaa so b\u025bte.\" means both will remain the same.

However, the question focuses on how labor supply changes regarding the number of people working, so (3) more directly suits the scenario.\n\nHence, the change is that labor supply (work) increases, but wages remain stable (fixed). Thus, the best answer is (3).", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 0}]
