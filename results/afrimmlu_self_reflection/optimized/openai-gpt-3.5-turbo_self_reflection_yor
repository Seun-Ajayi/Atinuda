While the UN Charter does provide some guidelines regarding immunity, it is not the sole source of immunity for international organizations.

However, immunity for international organizations is generally based on treaties, agreements, or customary international law rather than court decisions. Therefore, this option does not accurately reflect the source of immunity for IO.\n\nOption 4: This option mentions that immunity for IO is grounded in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

While this might have some impact on cost savings or other factors, it does not directly address the issue of inflation.\n\nOption 2 mentions that market prices should increase. This is not a viable solution as it can worsen inflation by contributing to a price-wage spiral.\n\nOption 3 proposes that businesses should become price gougers. Price gouging refers to the practice of raising prices unfairly during emergencies or crises, which is unethical and can lead to legal consequences.\n\nOption 4 states that businesses should invest in real assets.

If AVC is decreasing while moving down the short-run average total cost curve, this implies that AVC is below average total cost (ATC). This scenario suggests that costs are decreasing and the firm can potentially increase its profit margin. Therefore, option [1] seems correct.\n- AFC (Average Fixed Cost) is the fixed cost per unit of output. If AFC is decreasing, it means that fixed costs are being spread over more units of output, indicating that more units are being produced. This aligns with option [2].\n- MP (Marginal Product) indicates the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a variable input. If MP is decreasing, it suggests diminishing returns to the variable input. Hence, option [3] seems appropriate.\n- MC (Marginal Cost) is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of output.

Elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. In this scenario, the market is becoming more competitive due to an increase in the number of sellers.

Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the relationship between price, quantity demanded, and total revenue in a competitive market.\n\nOption 1 suggests that \"an increase in price does not lead to a decrease in quantity demanded,\" which contradicts the basic economic principle of demand: as price goes up, quantity demanded goes down. This option does not align with the scenario provided.\n\nOption 2 states that \"an increase in price leads to an increase in quantity demanded,\" which is inaccurate according to the law of demand. When the price rises, quantity demanded typically decreases rather than increases. This option does not reflect the correct relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n\nOption 3 mentions that \"an increase in quantity demanded does not lead to an increase in price,\" which does not align with the basic principle of supply and demand. When demand increases while supply remains constant, the price tends to rise. This option does not accurately represent the impact of changes in demand on price.\n\nOption 4 correctly states that \"an increase in quantity demanded and a decrease in price,\" reflecting the typical response to increased market competition.
