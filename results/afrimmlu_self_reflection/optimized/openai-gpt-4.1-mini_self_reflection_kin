Since 30 \u00d7 10^3 = 30000 is bigger by a factor of 10.\n\nGiven the answer choices, option [3] (or [4]) is the closest resemblance as it factors the product into (6 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10^3, which structurally corresponds to 6 \u00d7 500 (since 500 = 5 \u00d7 10^2).

It lacks clarity on the actual difference, making it unlikely to be correct.\n\n2. \u00abUbuhuza bukorwa nabahagarariye Umunyamabanga Mukuru wumuryango wabibumbye gusa, mu gihe ubuhuza bushobora kandi gukorwa nabakozi bibihugu bya gatatu\u00bb\n- This statement claims \"Ubuhuza is done only by representatives of the UN Secretary-General, while guhuza can also be done by third-country officials.\" It confuses the terms, since \"ubuhuza\" is often done by appointed mediators, which can include third parties, and \"guhuza\" is a broader term meaning conciliation or mediation. The explanation does not correctly differentiate.\n\n3. \u00abUbusanzwe, ubuhuza bukorwa numuntu washyizweho nimpande zombi, mu gihe ubwumvikane bugizwe na komisiyo isuzuma ikibazo nta kurobanura ku butoni kandi igatanga inama zo gukemura icyo kibazo.\u00bb\n- This option clearly explains that \"ubuhuza\" is usually done by a person appointed by both parties (a mediator), while \"ubwumvikane\" (an agreement) involves a commission that examines the problem non-judicially and gives recommendations. This well fits the typical distinction between mediation (ubuhuza) and a different, perhaps arbitration-like process (ubwumvikane) but the question is about \"guhuza\" vs. \"ubuhuza\" not \"ubwumvikane\".\n\n4. \u00abUmuhuza ni uburyo bwo gukemura amakimbirane bukurikizwa gusa hakurikijwe amasezerano, mu gihe uguhuza bishobora no kuba ku buryo bwihariye\u00bb\n- Here, \"umuhuza\" (mediator) is described as a method to resolve disputes only through agreements, while \"guhuza\" (conciliation or bringing together) can also happen in a special or informal way, not necessarily only through formal agreements. This implies a formal process for \"umuhuza\" and a more flexible process for \"guhuza,\" aligning with the subtle difference that mediation is a structured process versus conciliation being broader.\n\nGiven the above, option 4 best distinguishes the terms \"umuhuza\" (mediator) and \"guhuza\" (conciliation), noting that mediation is a method that depends on formal agreements, whereas guhuza can be informal. Option 3 addresses \"ubuhuza\" and \"ubwumvikane,\" which doesn't reflect the difference asked here. Options 1 and 2 are confusing or inaccurate.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is choice 4 (D).", "pred_answer": "D", "method": 0}, {"question": "Mu rubanza Osman v.

States that only the main organs of the UN can request advisory opinions, namely the Security Council, General Assembly, Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Trusteeship Council, and the Secretariat. However, the Trusteeship Council was suspended for its original purpose and the Secretariat generally does not request opinions. This option excludes the possibility of other authorized agencies, which contradicts the allowance for specialized agencies under authorization.\n\n2.

This is incorrect; only UN organs and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly can do so, not all international organizations.\n\n3.

In international law, the sources of law are typically categorized based on their binding nature and authority. According to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Statute Article 38, the primary sources are international treaties, customary international law, general principles of law, and subsidiary means such as judicial decisions and scholarly writings.\n\nThe General Assembly's resolutions are generally considered as non-binding recommendations or \"soft law.\" They do not have the force of treaties (which are binding agreements) nor custom (which binds once established by state practice and opinio juris). They can, however, contribute to the development of customary international law or clarify existing norms, but they do not in themselves bind member states.\n\nAnalyzing the choices:\n\n1. \"Imyanzuro ya GA ifatwa nk'amasoko y'amategeko mpuzamahanga y'inyongera, bityo ikaba ifunga ku bihugu\" - This suggests GA resolutions are subsidiary sources but are binding on countries. This is inaccurate because GA resolutions are generally not binding.\n\n2. \"Imyanzuro yinteko Rusange ni kimwe naamasezerano\" - This equates GA resolutions with treaties (agreements), which is incorrect; treaties are binding contracts, while GA resolutions are not.\n\n3. \"Imyanzuro yinteko Rusange yIgihugu ihora igaragaza amategeko asanzwe\" - This option is a bit unclear but seems to suggest GA resolutions always indicate general laws; however, GA resolutions are often recommendations and do not \"always indicate\" general laws or existing law.\n\n4. \"Ibyemezo byinteko Rusange bifatwa nkisoko ryibanze, mu buryo bwuko bishobora gutangaza imvugo zamategeko gakondo\" - This means GA decisions are considered a primary source because they may express customary international law. This is somewhat closer to legal thought: GA resolutions can reflect or contribute to customary international law (a primary source) by expressing legal opinions or \"opinio juris,\" but on their own, they are not primary sources.\n\nOverall, GA resolutions are considered \"subsidiary\" or \"non-binding\" sources but may influence the formation or clarification of customary international law and general principles.\n\nGiven this, option (1) is partly correct about subsidiary sources but incorrect about binding effect. Option (4) recognizes their role in expressing customary law, which is a primary source, hence they can be important but are not per se a primary source by themselves.\n\nTherefore, (4) is the most accurate: GA resolutions are considered an important subsidiary source that can state or reflect customary international law, but they are not binding treaties and cannot alone 'bind' countries.", "pred_answer": "D", "method": 1}, {"question": "Ese amasezerano afitanye isano nibihugu bya gatatu, ni ukuvuga ibitari ibihugu byayashyizeho umukono?

The contiguous zone doesn't normally grant rights to exploit mineral resources; that right belongs to the continental shelf or EEZ.\n\nC) \"Akarere gakikije ni agace igihugu cy'inkombe cyemerewe gukumira no guhana abarenga ku mategeko agenga amasoko, amategeko y'imisoro, amategeko agenga abimukira cyangwa amategeko arebana n'ubuzima\"\n- This aligns with the notion of a contiguous zone, where a coastal state may prevent or punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws within the contiguous zone, usually extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline. This matches the internationally accepted role of the contiguous zone under UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea).\n\nD) \"Akarere gakikije ni akarere igihugu cy'inkombe kirindamo ibintu by'ubuvumbuzi n'amateka yacyo\"\n- This option is vague and does not correspond to any established international maritime zone roles.\n\nBetween A and C, both mention security and enforcement roles, but C is more precise about specific laws and the state's rights to control and punish transgressions in the zone.

This is essentially the correct explanation of the effects doctrine.\n\nBetween [2] and [4], both mention jurisdiction related to harmful conduct, but [4] is clearer about jurisdiction being linked to the location of effects, which is the core of the effects doctrine.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option D ([4]).", "pred_answer": "D", "method": 1}, {"question": "Ni abahe bantu bafatwa nk;inzego za 'de facto' z'igihugu hakurikijwe amategeko mpuzamahanga ?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["Inzego za de facto' ni abantu bahawe ububasha n'amategeko bwo gukora mu nzego z'ubutegetsi", "Inzego de facto' ni abantu, mu by'ukuri, bakora ku mabwiriza y'icyo gihugu, cyangwa bayobowe na cyo cyangwa bagenzurwa na cyo mu gihe bakora ibikorwa bishobora gushinjwa icyo gihugu", "Inzego de facto' ni inzego za Leta de jure zikorera nta bubasha zifite cyangwa ultra vires", "Inzego z'ibanze\" ni inzego, ibikorwa cyangwa kudakora kwazo bidashobora kwitirirwa Leta"], "example_answer": "B", "reasoning": "The question asks about the definition of \"de facto\" organs of a state according to international law. \n\n- Option A states that de facto organs are those \"granted authority by law\" to operate in governance.

In reality, the Human Rights Act does not allow UK courts to strike down or invalidate primary legislation (Acts of Parliament).

Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good imposes costs on third parties not reflected in market prices, leading to overproduction from a societal standpoint.\n\nThe goal is to achieve an efficient level of output that accounts for these social costs. \n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n[1] \"Capitalisme y'isoko ryigenga\" (Free market capitalism) - This typically leads to market outcomes without government interference. Free markets alone often result in overproduction of goods with negative externalities, because producers do not internalize social costs. So this option is unlikely to achieve efficient outcomes.\n\n[2] \"Gushyira imipaka ku bwinshi bushobora gutunganywa\" (Imposing limits on the amount that can be produced) - This implies regulating production quantity to limit externalities. This is a direct way to reduce output to socially optimal levels.\n\n[3] \"Leta igura ibicuruzwa\" (Government purchasing goods) - Purchasing goods alone does not address negative externalities unless the government uses acquisition to reduce externalities. Without specifics, this option is less clearly linked to resolving externalities.\n\n[4] \"Gushyiraho umubare ntarengwa w'ibishobora gukorwa\" (Setting a maximum quantity that can be produced) - This is similar to option 2 but stated more explicitly.

This is a classic example of cross-price elasticity of demand.\n\nCross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the demand for one good to a change in the price of another good:\n\n- If the cross-price elasticity is positive (greater than zero), the goods are substitutes because an increase in the price of one good increases the demand for the other.\n- If the cross-price elasticity is negative (less than zero), the goods are complements because an increase in the price of one good reduces demand for the other.\n\nIn this case, the price of A rises by 5%, and the quantity demanded of B increases by 10%.

Marginal revenue is the additional revenue generated from selling one more unit, which is related to the demand curve, the average revenue, and price.\n\nIn a monopsony (a market with only one buyer), the analogous concepts involve input prices and input demand. The monopsonist faces an upward-sloping supply curve for labor or inputs (\"ibikoresho by'akazi\" or \"abakozi\"). The \"marginal factor cost\" or \"marginal cost of the input\" is the additional cost of hiring one more unit of input, which is related similarly to the supply curve as marginal revenue is to the demand curve in monopoly.\n\nThus, the marginal revenue in monopoly corresponds to marginal factor cost in monopsony, and demand corresponds to supply.\n\nAmong the choices:\n\n[1] \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\" means \"Labor demand\" \u2014 this is not correct because in monopsony, the firm is a buyer of labor and faces the supply curve of labor; the demand for labor is from other firms or labor market demand, but the monopsonist control is over supply.\n\n[2] \"Ibikoresho by'akazi\" means \"Inputs or factors of work\" \u2014 this is more general and not a curve or relationship.\n\n[3] \"Ikiguzi cyo hanze\" means \"Marginal (or external) cost\" \u2014 the cost that varies with output or input usage; this may correspond more with marginal factor cost but less precisely.\n\n[4] \"Ikiguzi cyose\" means \"Total cost\" \u2014 the overall cost, which is the integral of marginal cost.\n\nGiven the question asks for the term or curve analogous to demand in monopoly but in monopsony, the correct answer should be \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\" (\"Labor demand\") or the supply curve of labor.\n\nBut in monopsony theory, the firm's relevant curve is the supply curve of labor (the price of labor varies with quantity supplied), and the marginal factor cost (MFC) lies above the supply curve because hiring one more worker raises wages for all.\n\nGiven the question asks: \"The relationship between marginal revenue and demand in monopoly is like the relationship between marginal cost of the input and what in monopsony?\"\n\nIt is known that marginal factor cost relates to the supply curve of inputs (labor supply), so the analogous curve is the supply curve.\n\nHowever, \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\" means labor demand, which is not correct because the monopsonist considers the supply curve.\n\nNo direct \"supply curve\" is given; thus, the closest is \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\", but it is not strictly supply.\n\nSince this question is a classical analogy in microeconomics, marginal revenue relates to demand; marginal factor cost relates to supply.\n\nGiven the options, none explicitly says \"supply curve\" or \"labor supply.\"\n\nBetween the options, \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\" is demand for labor.\n\n\"Ikiguzi cyo hanze\" is \"Marginal cost,\" which is the curve marginal factor cost.\n\n\"Ikiguzi cyose\" is total cost.\n\n\"ibikoresho by'akazi\" is \"inputs.\"\n\nHence:\n\n- In monopoly: Marginal revenue relates to demand curve for output.\n\n- In monopsony: Marginal factor cost relates to supply curve.\n\nSo the analogy is:\n\nmonopoly: MR relates to demand.\n\nmonopsony: MFC relates to supply.\n\nSince supply curve is not given, the suitable answer is \"Ibyifuzo by'abakozi\" (labor demand) is not correct.\n\n\"Ikiguzi cyo hanze\" (marginal cost) is the cost curve, the corresponding curve in monopsony associated with marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is [3] \"Ikiguzi cyo hanze\" (external/marginal cost), corresponding to marginal factor cost, analogous to marginal revenue in monopoly.\n\nThus, the answer is [3].", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 0}, {"question": "Reka tuvuge ko ubu isoko ry'indabyo riri ku kigero cy'uburinganire.
