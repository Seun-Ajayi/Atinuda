      "instructions": "You are given a multiple-choice question with:\n- question: the prompt (may be written in Igbo or English)\n- subject: topical domain (e.g., global_facts, high_school_geography, high_school_microeconomics, elementary_mathematics, international_law)\n- choices: an ordered list of four answer strings corresponding to options A–D, in order\n\nYour task:\n- Determine the single correct answer from the provided choices.\n- Output ONLY the single uppercase letter A, B, C, or D that corresponds to the correct choice:\n  - A = choices[0]\n  - B = choices[1]\n  - C = choices[2]\n  - D = choices[3]\n- Do not output the answer text, explanations, labels, punctuation, numbers, or any extra whitespace—just the single uppercase letter.\n\nProcess and strategy:\n1. Parse and translate (if needed):\n   - If the prompt is in Igbo, translate or interpret key terms precisely (count vs. rate, definition vs. example).\n   - Use the subject to anchor domain reasoning.\n\n2. Identify the question type:\n   - Definition/term mapping (e.g., geography or international law concepts).\n   - Comparative statics in microeconomics (simultaneous shifts).\n   - Mathematics property/identity recognition.\n   - Global facts/history percentages.\n   - Market-structure properties or cost conditions.\n\n3. Select the most accurate choice based on domain knowledge and the prompt’s exact wording.\n\n4. Output only the corresponding letter (A–D). Never include extra characters or text.\n\nStrict answer-formatting rule:\n- Output exactly one character: A, B, C, or D.\n- No spaces, periods, newlines, or numerals. Even if asked for explanations, output only the single letter.\n\nIgbo translation and term cues:\n- ole = how many/what percentage\n- ọnụọgụgụ kachasi = the highest number (absolute count), not the rate\n- ụmụntakịrị = children\n- nwuru n'okpuru afọ ise = died under age five\n- Echiche na ... bụ ike na-emepụta mmepe omenala = The idea that ... is the driving force of cultural development\n- gburugburu ebe obibi = environment\n- a na-akpọ = is called\n- ajọ ihe = a bad/evil thing\n- nkenke oge = short run\n- ọnụ ahịa mmechi = shutdown price\n- ọnụahịa = price\n- opekata mpe/opekatampe = minimum\n- kacha elu = maximum\n- nkezi = average\n- agbanwe ego = variable cost\n- ngụkọta ọnụ (nkezi ngụpụta/ọnụ) = total cost (average total cost)\n- ihe mkpokọta/oke mgbanwe = marginal (use subject cues)\n- nkebi = zone/zoning (urban planning land-use divisions)\n- mmụba doro anya = definite increase\n- mbelata doro anya = definite decrease\n- mgbanwe na-enweghị atụ = indeterminate/ambiguous change\n- ịdọrọ ókèala mpaghara ntuli aka iji nye otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị uru na-ezighi ezi = gerrymandering\n\nDomain mappings and facts:\n\nHigh school microeconomics:\n- Shutdown point (short run) occurs when P = minimum of average variable cost (min AVC).\n- Simultaneous shifts (comparative statics):\n  - Demand ↑ and Supply ↑ → Equilibrium quantity ↑ definite; price ambiguous.\n  - Demand ↓ and Supply ↓ → Equilibrium quantity ↓ definite; price ambiguous.\n  - Demand ↑ and Supply ↓ → Price ↑ definite; quantity ambiguous.\n  - Demand ↓ and Supply ↑ → Price ↓ definite; quantity ambiguous.\n- Goods and Igbo mappings:\n  - Normal good: demand rises when income rises → nke dị mma kwesiri.\n  - Inferior good: demand falls when income rises → nke dị mma dị ala.\n  - Luxury good: income elasticity > 1 → nke dị oke mma.\n  - Public good: non-rival, non-excludable → nke dị ọha mma.\n- Monopolistic competition typically has excess capacity and P > MC (not allocatively efficient; do not pick P = MC for monopolistic/monopolistic competition unless explicitly stated otherwise).\n\nHigh school geography:\n- Possibilism (people, not environment, drive cultural development) = ikwe omume.\n- Environmental determinism = nkpebi gburugburu ebe obibi.\n- Cultural ecology = omenala ekọlọji.\n- Animism = animizm.\n- Urban planning divides land uses by zoning = nkebi.\n- Gerrymandering = ikewapụ/ịdọrọ ókèala iji nye uru ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị; Domino Theory = Ozizi domino (not gerrymandering).\n\nElementary mathematics:\n- Distributive property: a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n- Associative property: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c); (ab)c = a(bc).\n- Commutative property: a + b = b + a; ab = ba.\n\nInternational law:\n- UN Charter Article 51 permits self-defense in response to an armed attack; many interpretations allow for attacks by non-state actors in some circumstances.\n- The Caroline case is a key precedent for necessity and proportionality in self-defense, and is often cited regarding non-state actors.\n\nGlobal facts/history:\n- Carefully match requested measures (absolute count vs. rate; percentage vs. raw number). Do not confuse “ọnụọgụgụ kachasi” (highest count) with highest rate.\n\nKnown correct facts from prior items (use if encountered verbatim):\n- “Na 1948 ... Kinsey ...” percentage of Americans: correct choice is 11%, option D.\n- “Kedu n'ime mba ndị a ka-ọnụọgụgụ kachasi ụmụntakịrị nwuru n'okpuru afọ ise na 2017?”: correct is Pakistan, option D. Note: ọnụọgụgụ kachasi = absolute number.\n- “Echiche na ndị mmadụ, ma ọ bụghị gburugburu ebe obibi ha, bụ ike na-emepụta mmepe omenala ka a na-akpọ”: correct is ikwe omume (possibilism), option A.\n- “Mgbe egbe ogbunigwe atọm gasịrị ndị America ole na akwado inyere Japan aka ọbụnadị n'ihe ụkọ nri?”: correct is 66%, option C.\n- If both demand and supply increase (microeconomics): correct is “mmụba doro anya na ọnụọgụ na mgbanwe na-enweghị atụ na ọnụahịa,” option B.\n- “Omume ịdọrọ ókèala mpaghara ntuli aka iji nye otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị uru na-ezighi ezi” (gerrymandering): correct is “ikewapụ,” option B.\n- If average family income rises and quantity demanded of pork rises, pork is a normal good: “nke dị mma kwesiri,” option B.\n\nHandling duplicates in choices:\n- If multiple choices are identical textually, select the option whose text best matches the concept. If a known-correct fact above specifies an option index for that exact prompt, use that index. Otherwise, prefer the first occurrence.\n\nIf uncertain:\n- Use the subject context, translations, and domain knowledge to choose the most evidence-based option.\n- Prioritize the option that best matches the precise wording (e.g., count vs. rate, minimum vs. maximum).\n- Still output only the single letter A–D.",
