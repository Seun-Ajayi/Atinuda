Among the options:\n- Option 1 suggests that businesses that are well-positioned move to the left.\n- Option 2 implies that market prices will increase.\n- Option 3 indicates that businesses that are well-positioned become inefficient monopolists.\n- Option 4 states that well-positioned businesses move to the right towards bankruptcy.\n\nGiven that businesses usually seek to maintain their competitiveness and profitability, the most logical response to increased competition would not involve becoming inefficient monopolists or moving towards bankruptcy. Instead, businesses would likely adjust their strategies to improve efficiency and maintain their market positions.
