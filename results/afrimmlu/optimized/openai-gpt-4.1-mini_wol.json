Without additional data to make an exact calculation, it is best to identify which options fit a logical distribution pattern or a known fact.\n\nSince the question is elementary mathematics, likely about division or proportions, let's analyze the options:\n\n1) 10 children, 23 and 20 dollars\n2) 16 children, 36 and 48 dollars\n3) 13 children, 29 and 51 dollars\n4) 12 children, 27 and 60 dollars\n\nChecking if the total money is divisible amongst the children:\n\nOption 1: 23 + 20 = 43 dollars / 10 children = 4.3 dollars each (fractional, likely acceptable)\nOption 2: 36 + 48 = 84 dollars / 16 children = 5.25 dollars each (fractional)\nOption 3: 29 + 51 = 80 dollars / 13 children = approx 6.15 dollars (fractional)\nOption 4: 27 + 60 = 87 dollars / 12 children = 7.25 dollars (fractional)\n\nAll fractional, so not precise division required. Possibly the question or context suggests which is the correct combination.\n\nWithout further context, option A (choices[0]) seems the simplest and most reasonable starting index, but to be sure, note that 16 children with 36 and 48 dollars totals 84, which is divisible more evenly.\n\nAnother hypothesis is the sum of money corresponds to a set number of children.

Since 400 is given as a number of pencils, and the question is about pencils near 400, we consider the choices to find the one that fits the remainder condition. Likely, the number of pencils is slightly more than 400, and the remainder when divided by some base is to be identified. As the question's exact division base isn't clear, the best assumption is 400 itself is the divisor and the pencils are slightly less or more than 400. Among the choices, 397 is slightly less than 400, thus would yield a remainder of 397 when divided by 400. This fits the context best.",

This repeating decimal representation can be converted or rounded depending on the context, but none of the options look like continuous decimals or fractions.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n- [1] «46, 4» — looks like a number with a comma separating two parts, not fitting the decimal number format.\n- [2] «456» — a whole number, no decimal.\n- [3] «4, 56» — looks like two numbers separated by comma, possibly intended decimal notation or list.\n- [4] «45, 6» — again two numbers separated by comma.\n\nGiven the original number 5.7 with a repeating 8, the closest decimal approximation would be 5.78 or similar, but none of the options show this exact form.\n\nThis suggests the question might be about matching the number in the correct format or standard decimal number system notation among the options.\n\nTaking the comma as a separator for decimal notations, \"4,56\" in European format means 4.56 which is close to the original number 5.7(8), but less than it.\n\n\"45,6\" means 45.6, which is far from the original value.\n\n\"46,4\" means 46.4.\n\n\"456\" is just a whole number.\n\nGiven the options and typical decimal system representation, the closest or plausible reading for \"5,7(8)\" in decimal notation is \"4,56\" (4.56) among given options, although not mathematically equal, it aligns best with the question intent about decimal or positional notation.\n\nTherefore, the best fit choice is [3] «4, 56».",

    "example_answer": "B",
    "reasoning": "We need to evaluate the expression: 5 + 2 - 15 + (12 - 4). First, calculate the parenthesis: 12 - 4 = 8. Now the expression is: 5 + 2 - 15 + 8. Calculate step-by-step: 5 + 2 = 7; 7 - 15 = -8; -8 + 8 = 0. The result is 0, but 0 is not among the options. Rechecking calculations: 5+2=7, 7-15=-8, -8+8=0. None of the options matches 0, so none are correct per the calculation. Since none of the choices correspond to the correct evaluation of the expression, and the question might involve a different interpretation, let's check common arithmetic mistakes. Another approach: Maybe parentheses are interpreted differently: 5 + 2 - 15 + 12 - 4 = (5+2)-(15)+(12)-(4) = 7 - 15 + 12 - 4. Calculate stepwise: 7-15=-8, -8+12=4, 4-4=0. Still 0. All options are much higher numbers than 0. Maybe the options are incorrectly given, or the question expects a different operation. Is the question asking for multiplication? The prompt says \"walëru xaymaa bii\" which means \"evaluate this expression\". So calculation should be straightforward. Since none match, perhaps the intended expression is different or relates to the product of numbers: 5+2-15+(12-4) = 0 but no option is 0. Alternatively, the mistake is perhaps to interpret (12-4) as multiplication: 12*4 = 48, leading to 5+2-15+48=5+2=7, 7-15=-8, -8+48=40, no 40 in options. Or maybe the question incorrectly lists options. Given that all options are more than 1, and 1 is the closest to 0, the most plausible answer is 1 (choice A). So the best answer is A.",

This is about money, not division.\n- Choice B talks about 8 sets of something called \"Señ Kramer\" and 20 \"karaakeer\" and asks how many \"karaakeer\" are in each set. This suggests division: 20 items divided among 8 sets.\n- Choice C talks about Mitch buying something with 20 units of currency, each batch costing 8 units, and asks how many units Mitch bought in total. This also relates to division: 20 divided by 8 to find how many batches.\n- Choice D mentions 20 tempos bought by Donna, with 8 tempos used to move goods for one trip, and asks how many tempos Donna used for trips. This again is division: 20 divided by 8.\n\nAmong these, the question is most about division 20/8 and what result or meaning to assign. Given that the question asks \"Ban doxalin la xaajeb 20/8 mën a taawu?\", meaning \"What is the quotient of 20 divided by 8?\", the best match is the option that directly relates to dividing 20 by 8 and how many units or groups come out.\n\nChoices B, C, and D all involve 20 units divided by 8 units to find how many groups or purchases etc.\n\nChoice B: 8 sets of 20 \"karaakeer\" total? No, it says 8 sets of \"Señ Kramer\" and 20 \"karaakeer\" total, asks how many \"karaakeer\" per set, i.e., 20 divided by 8.\n\nChoice C: Mitch buys 20 units of currency worth of items, each batch costing 8 units: how many batches? This is 20/8.\n\nChoice D: Donna bought 20 tempos, uses 8 per trip, asks how many trips: again 20/8.\n\nBecause the question just asks \"What is the quotient of 20/8?\", the best choice specifying this is option C, which directly asks how many batches Mitch bought when batches cost 8 units each and he spent 20 units: simple division 20/8.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C.",

    "reasoning": "The question describes a number (ful) that is divisible by 2 numbers and is a multiple of 60. One of the numbers is either 12 or divides 12. The product of these two numbers is 2 times greater than the other, so twice one number equals the other. Since the full number is 60, the possible pairs of factors are:\n\n- 6 and 10: 6 * 10 = 60, and 10 is not twice 6 (10 ≠ 2*6=12)\n- 5 and 10: 5 * 10 = 50, no\n- 10 and 12: 10 * 12 = 120, no\n- 12 and 15: 12 * 15 = 180, no\n\nBut the question also says the number is divisible by two numbers whose product is greater than (gën a réy) the other by a factor of 2 or so.\n\nAlternatively, if the product of the two numbers equals 60 and one is either 12 or divides 12, and the numbers are in the ratio 2:1 (since the question says \"gën a réy ci ñoom ñaar mooy 2\").\n\nSo let's consider the pair 6 and 10:\n\n6 * 10 = 60\n\n10 is not exactly 2 times 6, but close.\n\nAlternatively, 5 and 12:\n\n5*12 = 60\n\n12 is more than twice 5 (12 > 10), not exactly 2.\n\nOr 4 and 15:\n\nNot given as a choice.\n\nOr 5 and 10:\n\n5 * 10 = 50, no.\n\nSo the only pair multiplying to 60 is 6 and 10.\n\n6 is a divisor of 12, and 10 isn't, but one can be equal to 12 or divides 12.\n\nTherefore, answer is [1] «6 ak 10».",

    "reasoning": "The sequence is 20, 40, 60, 80, ... which increases by 20 each time. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a_1 = 20 and common difference d = 20. The formula for the n-th term a_n is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. For the 7th term, a_7 = 20 + (7-1)*20 = 20 + 6*20 = 20 + 120 = 140. However, 140 is not among the choices. Double-checking the problem states \"juróom ñetteelu siifar\" which means seventh term. The terms given are 20, 40, 60, 80,... The 1st term is 20, the 2nd 40, 3rd 60, 4th 80, 5th 100, 6th 120, 7th 140. None of the options matches 140. Checking options, 160 matches the 8th term (20 + 7*20=160). Perhaps \"juróom ñetteelu\" means something else. “Ñetteelu” may mean \"multiple of seven\". So the question is for the “seventh multiple” of the base number (the difference), or the 7th in the sequence properly. Since the sequence is multiples of 20 (20*1, 20*2, ...), the 7th term is 20*7=140. Not an option. The options start from 160 (8*20). Since the options don't include 140, perhaps the question expects the closest matching correct choice. Possibly the wording refers to the 15th term (juróom - 5, ñetteelu - 7), summing them to get the 21st term (or misinterpretation). Or maybe it's a typo, the 7th term as in the 7th term after certain starting point. Alternatively, maybe they consider the terms as 20, 40, 60, 80,...  so the 7th term is 20*7=140 but options are 160 (8*20), 240 (12*20), 320 (16*20), 640. Among these options, 160 is the closest to 140, possibly a mistake in the problem. The best approximation is then 160, which is choice A.",

Among the choices, the option \"20 ci 5\" represents 20/5, which equals 4; \"24 ci 5\" equals 24/5, which is 4.8; \"4 ci 5\" equals 4/5, which is 0.8; \"28 ci 5\" equals 28/5, which is 5.6. None of these matches 40, but if the question is about combining these in terms of fractions or some form, the likely intended correct answer is \"20 ci 5\" because 20/5 equals 4, which could be the simplified form related to the sum and multiplication. Since \"Bindal 4 ak 4 ci 5\" literally means adding 4 and 4 in fifths, the correct calculation is (4 + 4)/5 = 8/5, which as a fraction is \"8 ci 5\", but this option is not present. The closest fraction to 8/5 (which is 1.6) among the options does not exist, so since the original question might mean 4 × 4 × 5, then 4 × 4 = 16 × 5 = 80, but 80 is not present either. Probably the question is about adding 4 and 4 in fifths: 4/5 + 4/5 = 8/5 = 24/15. Among the options, \"24 ci 5\" which is 24/5 = 4.8 is the closest to 8/5=1.6 times 3.

Given the question is about who has been excluded by the most industrialized countries, the choice would logically be those that are not industrialized or less developed. However, since the options are all industrialized countries except perhaps the first one which represents a group of countries, the question likely wants to identify which group has been most excluded by these industrial countries.

Option 2 best captures that prerogative powers provide the government the ability related to governance and executive functions, as prerogatives are about government conduct without parliamentary approval.\n\nOption 1 simply states the existence of a power but doesn't clarify its nature. Option 3, saying no fixed content and broadly extending, could be misleading as the prerogative powers have recognized limits.

Considering the choices:\n\n- Option 1 states that countries only accept that routes can be used freely by all—this aligns well with the principle of freedom of navigation.\n- Option 2 focuses on exceptions like penalties or wars needing justification, which is more about enforcement rather than the principle itself.\n- Option 3 suggests that the principle is something extendable when countries lack power, which is not the main principle.\n- Option 4 emphasizes respect for all humans and countries, but it blends ideas about peace and cooperation more than navigation rights.\n\nTherefore, Option 1 best matches the principle of freedom of navigation in international law.",

The correct understanding of sovereignty in international law is that it is not just about having a territory, or simple statements about falsity or truth, but about a state's capacity to have supreme authority and independence.\n\nOption 1 states that sovereignty is important for having a state that can exist, which is a typical definition aligning with sovereignty being the foundation of statehood.\n\nOption 2 claims sovereignty is nothing but statements that are true of states but do not concern shame, which is irrelevant.\n\nOption 3 says sovereignty is nothing but a natural right, which is a narrow and possibly incomplete definition.\n\nOption 4 says that sovereignty consists of words or claims concerning the independence of the state, which could refer to claims but doesn't fully describe sovereignty itself.\n\nTherefore, option 1 is the best and most comprehensive definition.",

This is not accurate as per ICJ practice; these bodies do not have standing as parties.\n\n2) Says all states in the world can bring a legal claim. Not accurate because only states (not entities such as NGOs or individuals) have standing, and not just any entity.\n\n3) States that only states and the UN General Assembly have standing to bring legal claims before the ICJ, as recognized under the UN Charter and current international law. This aligns best with the reality that only states have standing, and the UN organs have limited roles, but the General Assembly can request advisory opinions.\n\n4) Says UN member states, having primary importance, can bring legal claims and recognize the ICJ's authority.

Sovereignty in international law generally means that each state has authority over its territory and is recognized as equal to other states, and that no state can exercise jurisdiction over another without consent. \n\nReviewing the choices:  \n- [1] suggests sovereignty means the recognition of government authority and the right to self-defense or retaliation (gall-guuse). It emphasizes recognition and willingness to accept and respond to offenses.  \n- [2] talks about sovereignty as recognition of the highest rank or prestige of the government, which is a limited aspect of sovereignty and does not capture all rights or duties.  \n- [3] suggests sovereignty means that every state must recognize and acknowledge the authority of a state, implying respect and recognition but is vague.  \n- [4] indicates sovereignty as the exclusive right of a state over its own territory, stating that only the state itself is the rightful ruler.\n\nBased on the principle of sovereignty in international law, the fundamental idea is that the state exercises exclusive control over its territory and governance. Hence [4] best represents the core concept: \"doxalinu campéefu réew miy doxal rekk bu réew mi moo nekk ab jëfu réw moomu\", i.e., sovereignty means the exclusive jurisdiction of the state, and only the state itself has sovereignty.",

Among the choices, the one that correctly captures the idea that allegations or accusations concerning violations of human rights are given a certain priority or importance over other sovereign actions is the one stating that the courts recognize the importance of human rights claims (\"xalaatin yi jëm ci àq ak yelleefi doom-aadama yi\") even if other states or parties do not recognize such primacy (\"dul moom\"), but they place paramount importance on such claims (\"yi ëpp ci laalaake yi bokk ci\"). This choice aligns best with international legal principles involving state immunity exceptions for serious human rights violations, especially within European jurisprudence as reflected in the Al-Adsani case.

    "reasoning": "The question relates to the statement by Badinter on states forming in the former Yugoslavia, within the domain of international law. Badinter Commissions focused on issues like legal grounds for state succession, the respect for human rights, democratic principles, and the inadmissibility of territorial conquest, but particularly emphasized the protection of the rights of peoples and the principles of democracy and human rights in state succession contexts. Among the options, the one focusing on rights of individuals (àq ak yelleefi doom-aadama yi) and democracy stands out as most aligned with Badinter's principles against mere territorial claims. Options about \"copying rights\" or \"conquest\" are less aligned. The first option referencing the International Court of Justice and disputes is less directly related to Badinter's framing of the legal principles for the new states. Therefore, the best answer is the one about the protection of individual rights and democracy.",

Emphasizes studying weapons with thoughtfulness, carefulness about the path, understanding the weapon's purpose with explanation, analysis, and justification.\n2. Suggests weapons should be learned as understanding how to load the categories.\n3. Focuses on learning about the justification of destruction and how to avoid the use of the weapon.\n4. Says no one should learn anything other than practicing their stereotypes and their justification.\n\nThe most balanced, detailed and legally appropriate approach is option 1, which talks about studying weapons with reflection, ethical consideration, explanation, and justification, which matches how international law would advocate understanding weapons' use lawfully and ethically.",

    "reasoning": "The question relates to the general way countries behave regarding their borders in international waters, especially near their poor populations. The correct choice should reflect that countries with poor populations exploit or use their coastal waters in ways that may not be fully lawful or peaceful, potentially implying that these countries use their sea routes to avoid laws, or that these nations act in a way to maximize their economic advantage regardless of full legality. Among the given options, option [1] stands out because it talks about countries with poor populations doing illegal/illegitimate acts (\"dulu gàllankoor\") and acting without respect for peace or adaptation to societies. This fits the context of countries setting their maritime routes in international waters without due regard for legal or peaceful standards, which matches the idea of \"géej gi di jëmmëlee seen sàrti yoon\" (the sea where they mark their route). The other options are less complete or less fitting: option [2] suggests only making a route, option [3] discusses having excessive routes related to drugs, but is more specific, and option [4] implies lack of legal authority but is less relevant.

The correct answer should highlight the UN's founding purpose or principle, which is to maintain international peace and security through member states accepting new global paths or norms. Among the choices, option [1] states that the UN Charter obliges member states to accept new international paths, which aligns with the UN's role in promoting cooperation and peace. Option [2] merely mentions that the UN and its organs exist, without explaining the basis for peace. Option [3] suggests the UN Charter restricts only peaceful paths, which is inaccurate, and Option [4] references giving advisory opinions on legal pathways, which is more about the International Court of Justice rather than the founding purpose.

The key part of the question is about what these customs \"mean\" or \"represent\" in relation to those states that lack government. Among the choices, one stands out as fitting the legal understanding of custom in international law: customs are practices accepted as law, even in absence of formal government or treaties. The option that says customs are \"practices or habits acknowledged as binding by certain states because they recognize mutual agreement\" aligns with the concept that customary international law arises from consistent state practice accepted as law (opinio juris). This corresponds to choice 3: \"siife yi nekkuñu ay tënk walla ay àq ak yelleef ngir yenn réew yi ci loo xam ne àndu ñu ci\" meaning that customs are certain practices or habits that some states follow because they acknowledge shared understanding.

However, \"Sàrt 3\" is known from the UN Charter about peaceful settlement of disputes, but the question indicates the article that is not included.

The correct statement should reflect that all parties included in the international agreement are bound by it and are participants for its entire duration. Evaluating the choices:\n- Choice A says all parties to the international agreement are the parties that have signed it.\n- Choice B says all parties to the international agreement are those who have designated parties.\n- Choice C states that all parties to the international agreement are those nobody can judge, like the ICJ judge — this is incorrect and irrelevant.\n- Choice D says all parties to the international agreement are those that appear in the text we write or the contract that binds them together.\n\nBetween A and D, option A more directly answers the question about participants of an international agreement – these are those who are parties to all international treaties (wéy bokku yu si bérébu àtteekaay yëpp). The other options are less precise or incorrect.\n\nHence, the best answer is A.",

Among the options, option [1] states that the CIJ is not the court of last resort for dispute resolution, option [2] indicates that for territorial disputes, the CIJ acts as an arbitrator for some minor disputes, but not for many or major ones, option [3] disputes the court's role in the Nicaragua case, and option [4] says the CIJ cannot refuse jurisdiction in a case.\n\nThe correct understanding in international law is that the ICJ does not necessarily serve as a last resort for minor or trivial disputes and can refuse jurisdiction in some cases; it also functions as a main judicial body for state disputes but does not handle all disputes indiscriminately. Option [2] best captures the nuanced role that the ICJ plays with regard to territorial disputes: it handles some but not all minor disputes, aligning with the question's emphasis on \"jêffinu yu ñakk solo\" (minor issues), while noting the court's selective handling of cases.",

The question asks about the legal stance on whether a state can transfer sovereign rights or authority over its territory to another state. The most accurate principle is that a sovereign state cannot transfer more sovereign powers or rights to another state than it possesses, and any such transfer must be legal and consensual. Option A reflects this principle by stating that if a sovereign state cannot impose all conditions it wants, it must give other states the possibility to have the most rights possible but must always protect its own sovereignty and balance with other states' interests. The other choices either incorrectly suggest automatic or forced transfers or deny the possibility of sovereignty transfer outright. Hence, A is the best fit.",

The principle refers to the concept of sovereignty and the limits of a state's power, emphasizing that one state should not interfere directly in the jurisdiction of another state within its own territory. The precise and customary formulation of this principle is usually aligned with a state's inability to assert jurisdiction that purely extends into another state's territory in a way that bypasses that state's sovereignty. Among the choices, option [1] aligns best as it states the rule that one state cannot exercise jurisdiction in another state's territory because the latter has sovereignty over its own people and territory.

Human rights (\"Sañ-sañi doomu aadama yi\").\n\nAmong these, political and inheritance laws combined with corruption are often complex and challenging to comprehend compared to straightforward community laws, customs, or human rights laws.

    "reasoning": "La question demande quelle affirmation correspond à la possibilité pour \"bérébu àtteekaay\" (ensemble des traités) qui affectent une partie à un traité impliquant un autre État, particulièrement dans le contexte de la taille relative des traités ou leur relation dans le système international. En droit international, il est généralement admis qu'un traité ne peut imposer des droits ou obligations à un État tiers sans son consentement, sauf exception. L'option qui mentionne que seuls les traités entre États qui sont parties acceptent ces obligations, et tous les traités ne s'appliquent pas ou ne sont pas imposables à tous, donne une lecture conforme au principe du consentement des États. \n\nL'option [3] dit : «bérébu àtteekaay yi ñeel waa biir ak bitim réew bokk na ay gëm gëmu yoonu ak bérébu àtteekaay yoon yu si réew, waaye du yëpp.» Cela signifie que l’ensemble des traités qui relient une partie à un autre État contient des influences et liens avec d’autres traités territoriaux de ce pays, mais pas tous. Cela reflète la réalité qu'un traité n'affecte pas nécessairement tous les autres liens territoriaux.\n\nLes autres options indiquent des idées moins compatibles: \n- [1] semble dire que ces traités peuvent être combinés (booloo), ce qui n’est pas une règle générale en droit. \n- [2] parle de l'ONU comme autorité pour regrouper ou relier tous les traités, ce qui n'est pas exact car l'ONU ne réglemente pas tous les traités bilatéraux ou multilatéraux. \n- [4] indique que seuls les plus grands traités régissent le reste, ce qui ne correspond pas vraiment au droit international.\n\nPar conséquent, l'option [3] semble la plus correcte.",

    "reasoning": "The question in Wolof translates roughly to \"What is the meaning of 'lan mooy tekki baat yi di' yoon gu soxal ñëpp'?\" This phrase relates to an internationally significant concept, likely related to international law or diplomacy, specifically how a path ('yoon') affects or involves all people ('soxal ñëpp'). The correct answer should express a concept of a path or process involving all people, likely in terms of treaties, agreements, or laws that concern everyone collectively.\n\nOption A talks about a path involving all people as those the person recognizes - seems incomplete.\nOption B describes the path involving all people known as those parties the person knows and associated with them - seems personal.\nOption C describes a path involving the assembly being very close to all people - less suitable with context international law.\nOption D states that the path that affects all includes matters and similar paths and paths affecting no one outside the groups involved - this closest aligns with the idea of international paths or agreements affecting groups or international relations.\n\nThus, option D best fits the international law context, about a collective path affecting all involved parties, which aligns with the idea of treaties or international cooperation.",

The correct option should describe the idea that knowledge and facts arise from observation and study, involving communities or states, and that these realities have meaning in the interactions of states. Option 1 clearly explains that a fact (reality) emerges from knowledge that comes from observation and study and involving membership in communities and states interacting based on their interests.

The correct definition should relate to the absence of settlement or resolution of territorial disputes in a lawful or recognized manner. Option [4] mentions the lack of settlement regarding a territorial dispute in a country and the absence of recognition by international laws or treaties, which best fits the concept of unresolved or disputed territorial claims. Other options either do not explicitly focus on the lack of legal resolution or mix concepts unrelated to the legal dispute resolution itself.

The correct statement should accurately reflect the purpose and effect of the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporates European rights into British law and ensures that public authorities respect those rights.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n[1] Talks about \"si gis gis bu soriwul dara bu matuwaay yu nu mëna tërel te nguur gi jël ko, dogalug négàndiku yi tënkul kenn.\" This is vague and does not clearly represent the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\n[2] \"dogal 1998 bu aju si sàrt ak yeeleefu doomi aadama, nit ki mën naa tax bérébu àtteekaay bi mu ni li aju si yoon ba nu daan sukkànidiku bu njëkk wérul.\" This is more about the Human Rights Act 1998 guaranteeing rights for all citizens and their importance.\n\n[3] \"dogalug 1998 buy wax si àk ak yeeleef u doomi aadama (Human Rights Act 1998) dafa tax bépp nit bu am firndé yu wér mu yoobu mbir mi ca bérébu àtteekay bu mag ba.\" This directly states the Human Rights Act 1998 covers all citizens' fundamental rights across the legal system, which is accurate.\n\n[4] Mentions \"dog 1998 buy wax xi àkk ak yelleefu doomi aadame dafa boole ci sàrt yoon yi yu waa EU ci biir li yoon u waa britanique tërël.\" While it mentions the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporating EU rights, this is a slight misstatement because the Human Rights Act 1998 primarily incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (Council of Europe, not EU) into UK law.\n\nTherefore, the most factually precise and true statement aligned with international law and the Human Rights Act 1998 is choice [3].",

International law treats treaties as binding agreements entered into by states and governed by international norms, often formalized in written form. Option [1] describes treaties as legal agreements involving consent and recognition by the International Court of Justice (CIJ) and maintained between states. The other options are less precise or less aligned with formal international law concepts: [2] talks about partial agreements but lacks clarity about legal recognition; [3] mentions only political agreements without legal basis; [4] talks about agreements established by one state affecting a third party, which does not describe treaties accurately.\n\nTherefore, option [1] best fits the recognized definition of a treaty in international law.",

The correct definition should acknowledge that jurisdiction generally involves authority over persons, property, or events within the state's territory but may have some extraterritorial application when permitted. Option [4] mentions that jurisdiction generally pertains to the territory but is not limited strictly to it, pointing out that jurisdiction in international law may sometimes extend beyond the state's borders.

The correct understanding is that international law arises to regulate relations between states and not just within a single country; it consists of rules that countries agree to follow in their mutual interactions.\n\nThe options break down as follows:\n- Option [1] indicates that international law regulates relations between all parties and prescribes rules before actions are taken in the state, which aligns with international law being a set of agreed rules among states.\n- Option [2] says international law does not have a different status inside a country, which is incorrect since international law governs relations between countries.\n- Option [3] refers to international law as something that ensures countries obey when they enter within a state's path, which is confusing and appears inaccurate.\n- Option [4] says international law comes from rules that everyone who joins enters into domestic jurisdiction, which misrepresents international law as domestic law.\n\nHence, the best and most accurate definition is Option [1].",

The correct legal understanding is that customary international law arises from consistent state practice accompanied by a belief that such practice is legally obligatory (opinio juris), not merely because it is universally accepted or codified in treaties. Option [3] states that customary law is binding because it arises from the general practice of states over time (\"dafa aju ci bérébu àtteekaay bu mag bi\"). This corresponds to the principle that customary international law is formed through general and consistent state practice.

The options describe aspects of disputes, negotiation, or political processes related to law (possibly \"jàmmu xuloo\" referring to the dispute resolution or adjudication process).\n\nOption [1] involves recognition of procedural steps in legal disputes and mentions a legal court (CIJ, International Court of Justice) and that the process must be voluntary among states, which fits well with conventional international law understanding of dispute resolution.\n\nOption [2] states that political processes can't be imposed on the legal dispute area, which seems less precise and somewhat negative or restrictive.\n\nOption [3] mentions political steps leading to legal disputes and a process of legal proceeding but appears a bit vague and less complete.\n\nOption [4] says that current political processes and legal disputes can't be used for certain important legal disputes and to identify political steps used for all disputes, which is confusing and seems contradictory.\n\nGiven the context of international law and dispute resolution, the best and most precise description of the relationship between political actions and legal disputes is the one that recognizes the role of the facade of cooperation among states and the jurisdiction of the ICJ in the process, as in option [1].",

The correct option should reflect the idea that the country where the ship is registered (flag state) exercises jurisdiction and responsibility over that ship, including enforcement of laws and punishments.\n\nOption 1 says every country can show jurisdiction over ships of other countries—this is incorrect because jurisdiction generally belongs to the flag state unless exceptions apply.\n\nOption 2 says countries can show their authority over their citizens on ships of other countries in the sea; this is also not standard practice under international law.\n\nOption 3 states that the coastal state must carry out enforcement on big ships within the sea but only in limited cases related to serious matters affecting the coastal state—this corresponds to the principle of coastal state jurisdiction in its territorial sea but not beyond.\n\nOption 4 says the flag state alone is responsible for carrying out punishments over big ships in the sea and has exclusive jurisdiction—this aligns with international law principles where flag state jurisdiction is primary over its ships on the high seas.\n\nTherefore, the best answer that matches international law principles is option 4.",

The marginal product values given (200 and 50) likely relate to production or output per labor unit. The labor market response depends on whether marginal revenue product (MRP) is higher or lower than wages, influencing whether more or fewer workers are hired. In the choices, the terms \"yokk\" and \"waññi\" mean increase and decrease, respectively, and the correct economic behavior says: when marginal product times price (MRP) is higher than wage, increase labor; when it is lower, reduce labor.

Total chips she can buy are 12, and total cost (money spent) is 30 dollars. The problem is about optimizing her consumption so that she spends all her budget and maximizes utility. To do so, she needs to give up some cheaper pombiteers (which are less expensive) and buy more expensive pombiteers until the marginal utility per dollar spent is equalized.\n\nFrom the choices, the one that describes giving up some cheap pombiteers first and then increasing the expensive pombiteers to spend the total budget of 30 aligns best with this idea.",

The term \"tàngalu galaas yi\" implies the opportunity cost or additional expenses incurred because of the choice. In economics, the opportunity cost of choosing more expensive or better-quality goods is often described as the \"opportunity cost\" or \"what must be given up.\" Among the options, the one that best fits the concept of opportunity cost or additional cost in items bought or chosen is related to \"amal njumte ci sàrtub laajce gi nu tërël\" which means the additional expense incurred due to selection.

    "reasoning": "The question asks: \"What is 'leeral' in the strict (exact) sense?\" In microeconomics, \"leeral\" typically corresponds to \"profit.\" The strict definition of profit is the difference between total revenue and total costs, including both explicit and implicit costs. Option [2] states: \"njegu koom koom = njëg yu nu leeral yi ak njëg yu nu leeralul\" which translates as \"total revenue equals revenues that are accounted for (profit) and revenues that are not accounted for,\" which is not an exact definition of profit but rather total revenue decomposition. Option [3] states: \"njëgu koom koom gi = revenues we do not account minus revenues that are not accounted for,\" which is contradictory. Option [1] says \"benefit of total cost equals benefit lost,\" which is not the strict definition. Option [4] says \"njëgu njariñ= benefiisu koom koom,\" meaning \"accounting profit equals economic profit,\" which is not correct because accounting profit and economic profit differ. The closest and correct strict definition from the choices is option [2], defining strict profit as total revenue minus total cost (including all costs), which is what \"njegu koom koom\" means here.",

Among the options, «palastik» (plastic), «liggéeyub daamar» (wage labor), «nosukaay» (tools or instruments), and «Ngelaw» (land). In microeconomics, capital broadly refers to physical inputs used in production, generally including tools and machinery, but labor and land are distinct from capital. Labor is a factor of production but not capital; land is another distinct factor. Plastic is a material but is not a category of capital goods. Tools (nosukaay) are a classic example of physical capital because they are used in production to help produce goods and services. Thus, the best choice representing capital, including the fundamental form of capital in production, is «nosukaay».",

Among the options, choice [2] \"anam gi nuy jëffandikoo ngir defar esᾶᾶs dafy jëm kanam\" translates roughly as \"the method of using to produce capital tends forward,\" which aligns with the concept of capital accumulation and the increasing usefulness of capital. The other options about houses ceasing, the depreciation of physical and human capital, or the price of petrol are less directly related to the increasing useful value of capital goods.",

    ],
    "example_answer": "B",
    "reasoning": "The question asks about what kind of growth is associated with improvements in the productivity of factors of production in the long run. In microeconomics, long-run growth due to improvements in factor productivity corresponds to an increase in the productivity of capital and labor inputs, which refers to \"total factor productivity\" or more generally \"productivity growth\" of the inputs, not just the growth in quantities of inputs themselves.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n1. \"yokkuteeg limu borom lijaasa yi\" – implies growth in managerial inputs, less relevant.\n2. \"yokkuteeg njëgu tubas yi\" – growth in capital stock, but not specifically productivity.\n3. \"ab yokkuteeg njëgu njàngum tuba yi\" – growth in labor productivity.\n4. \"yokkute juuti si njëgu tuba yi\" – growth specifically in labor input.\n\nSince the question is about productivity growth of factors (labor and capital), the best fit would be growth in labor productivity since it relates directly to output produced per unit of labor, which reflects productivity improvements.\n\nTherefore, option 3 is the best choice.",

    "reasoning": "The question asks about the concept when an additional unit produced increases total cost, indicating diminishing returns or \"wàññeeku\" in Wolof (likely meaning \"diminishing\" or \"inefficient\" production increase). Among the choices, the correct interpretation is that the factor that increases the quantity of labor (liggéey) but the total output (dafay wàññeeku, i.e., diminishing) means increasing labor causes less than proportional increase in product or even reduction. The choice that matches this concept is choice 2: «mëññeef yu liggéey kat di defar dafay wàññeeku» which translates roughly to \"The productivity of labor used to produce is diminishing,\" meaning as labor increases, production depreciates. The other options either invert the relationship or discuss output disappearing, but do not correctly address diminishing returns.",

    "reasoning": "Anam yi lay lim aju wul ci ab bérébu defarukaay buy wujjànte ci lu wér deals with what is dominant or most influential in a production period. Among the options:\n\n[1] «dugg bu yomb ci biir bérébu dafarukaay bi» means initial investment or entry into production period;\n[2] «wuteeleeg meññeef yi» refers to the exhaustion of factors or resources;\n[3] «rëddub naatal buy soopeeku numu ko neexe» means the resolution of issues or the arrangement of matters to make exchange pleasant;\n[4] «ay meññeef yu nu tolloole ca defar ba» means errors made during production.\n\nThe dominant factor in a production period is typically the use of productive resources, best reflected by the use or exhaustion of factors of production. Hence, option [2] «wuteeleeg meññeef yi» (\"exhaustion of resources\") answers what largely influences the production period's output product.",

    "reasoning": "The question involves understanding the relationship between a main resource (wujjànte) used with a scarce input (lu bérébay jëffàndikoo) and a secondary resource (jabbà) used to produce a certain quantity of a good. The description hints at the classical economic concept of production efficiency, where \"fayal\" (scarce) and \"jëll\" (abundant) relate to resource availability. The statement suggests a scenario with scarce main input but abundant secondary input or labor. Option 2, \"fayal lu néew, te jëll ay liggéey kat yu i toll,\" (scarce raw resources but abundant workers), best fits this scenario due to the mention of using more labor (jabbà) relative to the scarce primary resource. This aligns with principles of substituting labor for scarce capital or inputs in production.",

    ],
    "example_answer": "A",
    "reasoning": "The question discusses a situation where a monopolistic (single) producer is buying an input, implying it is a monopsony in labor market terms. In such a market, the monopsonist faces a labor supply curve that is upward sloping, meaning to hire additional workers, it must pay a higher wage to all workers. The key is that the marginal factor cost (wujje gi) – the cost of hiring an additional unit of labor – is generally higher than the wage rate paid to existing workers (payoor gi). This is because the monopsonist must raise wages to attract more workers, not just for the marginal worker but for all, causing marginal cost to exceed average cost (wage).\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n- [1] \"ñaar yéppay yokk\" (all payments increase) – vague and less precise.\n- [2] \"ñaar yéppay wara wàññeeku\" (all payments must decrease) – not consistent with theory.\n- [3] \"payoor gi dafa wara yemm fumu ne, waaye xaymaag liggéey bi dafa wara yokk\" - The wage must stay the same, but the marginal cost increases. This is inconsistent; wage must increase in monopsony.\n- [4] \"payoor war naa mëna wacc, waaye liggéey bi war naa mëna yokk\" - wage may be lower, but marginal cost must be higher. This aligns best with standard monopsony theory.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct choice.",
