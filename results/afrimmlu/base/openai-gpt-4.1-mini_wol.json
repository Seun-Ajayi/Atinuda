In the morning, he looked at 34 fish, and that equals half the total number of fish he looked at during a trip (represented as 'njolloor gi'). So, if 34 fish is half the total, the full number of fish looked at during the trip is 34 * 2 = 68 fish.\n\nLater, he looked at 76 fish, and the question asks: how many fish in total did he look at during the trip?\n\nSince the trip involves twice the number of fish he looked at initially (which was 34), presumably the total number should include both counts: initial 68 half-day trip plus the additional 76 fish?\n\nHowever, the problem says \"wo\u00f1\u00f1i na 34 picc yu \u00ebpp yi mu wo\u00f1\u00f1i woon ci njolloor gi\" means 34 fish represent half the total fish seen on the trip. So total fish at that point is 68 fish.\n\nThen he saw 76 fish later. The question \"\u00f1aata ci ay picc la wo\u00f1\u00f1i ci njolloor gi?\" means \"how many more fish did he see on the trip?\".\n\nSo the total fish is the sum of half the trip's fish (34) times 2 = 68 and the 76 fish seen later. But since 34 is half of the total trip fish seen, and 76 is a new count, actually the total fish counted is 76 (the latest number) or the total fish in the trip is 68.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the meaning is that in the morning (suba), he saw 34 fish, which is half of the total he saw on the trip (in total njolloor gi). So the total fish on the trip is 68 fish.\n\nThen, if he saw 76 fish, that suggests the total fish number is 76 fish.\n\nBut the question after \"Su dee wo\u00f1\u00f1i na 76 picc\" means \"if he saw 76 fish, how many fish did he see on the trip?\" Probably, this is an extension.\n\nIf morning fish (34) is half total (68), and he saw 76 fish, which is an increase, meaning twice fish seen is proportional. So, if 34 corresponds to half total fish 68, then 76 fish corresponds to (76 / 34) \u00d7 68 fish total = (76/34)*68 = 2.235\u00d768=~152 (which is not in options).\n\nAlternatively, maybe this needs to be related differently.\n\nGiven the options: 21, 40, 42, 84.\n\nNotice that 42 is double 21.\n\n84 is double 42.\n\nSince 34 is half total, total is 68, which is close to 84 from options.\n\nBut 34 is less than 40 and 42.\n\nIf 34 is half fish, then total fish = 68 which is not an option. So 84 is closest and is exactly 42*2.\n\nIf 76 fish equals double the amount he initially saw 34, then 76 is more than double.\n\nBut 42 fish equals 21x2.\n\nHence, the only answer that fits proportional doubling is 84 fish.\n\nThus, the answer is 84 fish.", "pred_answer": "D", "method": 0}, {"question": "Lan mooy wal\u00ebru xaymaa bii 5 + 2 - 15 + (12-4) ?", "subject": "elementary_mathematics", "choices": ["78", "83", "131", "153"], "example_answer": "B", "reasoning": "First, solve the expression inside the parentheses: (12 - 4) = 8.  \nThen substitute back into the expression: 5 + 2 - 15 + 8.  \nCalculate step by step:  \n5 + 2 = 7  \n7 - 15 = -8  \n-8 + 8 = 0  \nThe result is 0, which does not match any of the given choices.

First, calculate 3 \u00d7 4 = 12. So, the equation becomes 12 \u00d7 x = 24. To find the value of x, divide both sides by 12: x = 24 \u00f7 12 = 2. Now we need to compare this result with the given choices. The choices are 18, 32, 72, and 96, none of which directly equals 2.

There might be a misunderstanding: maybe the question asks which of the choices matches the product 3 \u00d7 4 * x = (one of the choices), or maybe the question has a typo or refers to something else.\n\nAlternatively, if the question implies 3^4 * x = 24, which is 3 to the power of 4 times x equals 24. 3^4 = 81. Then 81 * x = 24, leading to x = 24/81 \u2248 0.296, which is not among choices.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and assuming the original problem is 3 \u00d7 4 * x = 24, which simplifies to 12 * x = 24, therefore x = 2. Since 2 is not among the given options, likely the question wants the value of 3 * 4 * x equal to which choice when x is known.\n\nAlternatively, if x is 6, then 3 * 4 * 6 = 72, which matches choice 3.\n\nSo perhaps the question is saying: \"Defal xayma bii : 3 ci 4 * x = 24.\" In Oromo, \"Defal\" possibly means \"What is,\" \"xayma\" could be \"multiply\" or \"value.\" Reinterpreting the equation for 3 \u00d7 4 * x equals 24, x = 2, but x is not an option.\n\nRe-examining, maybe the term \"ci\" means addition (?) so 3 + 4 * x = 24.\n\nTrying 3 + 4 * x = 24,\nthen 4x = 21,\nx = 21/4 = 5.25, which is not among options.\n\nOr maybe the original notation is 3 * (4 * x) = 24.\n\n3 * (4x) =24,\nthen 12x=24,\nx=2.\n\nAgain, 2 is not an option.\n\nTry if the question is asking for the product 3 * 4 * x equals which of the numbers given if x is one of the options.\n\nTest options:\n\nx=18: 3*4*18=3*72=216 (not 24)\n\nx=32: 3*4*32=3*128=384\n\nx=72: 3*4*72=3*288=864\n\nx=96: 3*4*96=3*384=1152\n\nNone is 24.\n\nAlternatively, is the question just asking: What is 3 times 4 times x equals 24?

So, \"rose\" in the question likely refers to what the convention treats as a rock or island.\n\nAmong the choices, option [3] best corresponds to a legal definition linked to article 121(3) of UNCLOS about features lacking entitlement because of their inability to sustain habitation or economic life, which matches the context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [3].", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 1}, {"question": "Lan la dayo yoon bu \u00ebmb r\u00e9ew y\u00e9pp di firi ?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["loolu dafay wone ne r\u00e9ew yi rekk lanu j\u00e0ppe ni ay yoonali s\u00e0rtu \u00e0dduna", "loolu m\u00ebn a tekki ne am na ay \u00e0q ak yelleef ak ay wareef yu t\u00ebnku ci yoonu \u00e0dduna si ak itam yaatuwaayu mbagg yi lu laaj ngir fexe ba, waa ji mu soxal j\u00ebfe leen", "loolu li muy tekki mooy ab p\u00e0cc m\u00ebn naa  \u00f1\u00e0kk a \u00e0nd ci doole ji nu jox r\u00e9ew yi", "aw waxin la wuy xamle ay niti yoon, loolu wuute ak j\u00ebmmi nit rekk, bu nu sukkandikoo ci yoon wi t\u00ebnk r\u00e9ew y\u00e9pp"], "example_answer": "B", "reasoning": "The question in Wolof is about defining what an \"ay yoon bu \u00ebmb r\u00e9ew y\u00e9pp di firi\" means, which translates roughly to \"a channel or way that concerns all countries.\" Looking at the choices:\n\n[1] describes it as a situation where only countries agree that channels are necessary internationally.\n\n[2] explains it as something that can ensure there are laws, rights, and international relations with respect and exchanges for the benefit of those who act.\n\n[3] describes it merely as a conflict that may lack power from countries.\n\n[4] talks about agreements among nations concerning channels or ways that unite all countries.\n\nAmong these, option [2] aligns best with the concept of international law as it mentions laws, rights, and mutual respect among nations, which is the core of international relations or international law.", "pred_answer": "B", "method": 1}, {"question": "Ban ci jumtuwaay yii moo nekk aw x\u00e0ll ngir aar \u00e0q ak yelleefi doom-aadama yi sosoo ci ab siife ?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["Ndiisoog \u00e0q ak yelleefu nit \u00f1i bu mbootaayi xeet yi", "Ndiisoog \u00e0q ak yelleefi mbootaayi xeet yi", "xaymab jamono bu mataleb Mbootaayi xeet yi", "m\u00e0ndaa yu r\u00e0\u00f1\u00f1iku yu Mbootaayi xeet yi"], "example_answer": "A", "reasoning": "Jumtuwaay yi ci \u00abaw x\u00e0ll ngir aar \u00e0q ak yelleefi doom-aadama\u00bb mooy j\u00ebme ci am ndam yi am ci mbootaayi xeet ak jafe-jafe yu mel ni xeex, j\u00e0mma, walla tuuti doomu aadama.

This is plausible, as the EU developed human rights policies.\n\n[2] Claims that in 1990, it's well known the European Community assured immigrants and children of immigrants because of the type of work they were to do. This seems less about law and more about labor rights, which may not align fully with the question's context.\n\n[3] Explains that since 1990, the European Community assured protection for immigrants and children because of certain problematic social conditions such as discrimination and deprivation. This fits with human rights approaches in Europe, focusing on social justice.\n\n[4] States that the European Community leading in the protection of immigrants and their children really began because of regional cooperation among member states after the 1990s. This contextualizes the protection as a regional political process, which is also accurate.\n\nComparing all, choice [3] captures the essence by explaining the assurance towards immigrants and their children on the basis of social problems such as discrimination and lack of access, which is a key concern of international law and human rights in Europe. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate or truthful statement in the context of international law and the European Union in the 1990s would be option [3].", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 0}, {"question": "Lan mooy njari\u00f1u boolee doole ci yeneen pexe yi nguur gu nu boddi am ?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["r\u00e9ew mi nu boddi m\u00ebn na j\u00ebfandikoo yoon y\u00e9pp ak doxalinu ki ko cong", "r\u00e9ew mi nu boddi m\u00ebn na sukkandiku ci g\u00e0nnaay yi mu yore y\u00e9pp ngir faagaagal walla g\u00e0ntal pexey looraangey ki ko song", "r\u00e9ew mi nu boddi m\u00ebnul a sukkandiku lu dul ci jumtuwaay yi ak doole ji war ngir daan w\u00e9y-conge bi", "r\u00e9ew mi nu too\u00f1 m\u00ebnul a def dara te Ngoblaanu kaaraange gi joxu ko ci ndigal"], "example_answer": "C", "reasoning": "Ci nguur gu nu boddi, doole ba mu am itam am na ci lu m\u00ebn a benn r\u00e9ew sukkandiku ci jumtukaay ak doole yi war ngir daan w\u00e9y-conge bi.

Option [1] mentions that a party binds only those who have joined the treaty, which aligns with basic treaty law: obligations arise only for states that consent to the treaty. Option [2] suggests the treaty could bind the entire international community, which is generally not true unless it is customary international law or a peremptory norm (jus cogens). Option [3] says there's no global mechanism for enforcement and no universal link among treaties, which is partially true but does not directly address whether large treaties have binding force. Option [4] indicates that large or important treaties have the same binding force as any treaties, which also fits international law but is less precise than [1]'s explanation about consent as the basis for binding effect.\n\nSince the question seems to focus on whether large treaties have binding effect, the best answer is [1], which explicitly states that a treaty binds only the parties who have consented to it, meaning the binding effect is limited to those states.", "pred_answer": "A", "method": 0}, {"question": "R\u00e9ewub d\u00ebkk\u00e0ndoo yi ndax amnanu sa\u00f1 sa\u00f1 napp si w\u00e0ll wiy jox koom-koomu beneen r\u00e9ew.?", "subject": "international_law", "choices": ["bu fekke ni r\u00e9ewu d\u00ebkkandoo manula dajale l\u00e9pp lunu napp, dafa wara bayyi yeneen r\u00e9ew yi \u00f1u m\u00ebna jott si li si \u00ebpp, danu wara farataal r\u00e9ew si seen doole bariwul ak r\u00e9ew yi nga xamni aksi fa yombul", "R\u00e9ewi tiers yi dunu m\u00ebsa m\u00ebna aksi si b\u00e9r\u00e9bu napp kaay yi f\u00e9et\u00e9 si w\u00e0ll wu beneen r\u00e9ew bu f\u00e9et\u00e9 tefes yayo si koom-koom", "r\u00e9ewum tefes yi danoo wara yombalal napp ngi seeni d\u00ebkkandoo si b\u00e9rebu koom koomu yi f\u00e9et\u00e9 tefes", "r\u00e9ew yi seen amul dool\u00e9 m\u00ebnees nanoo nappee si b\u00e9rebu nappukaay r\u00e9ewu tefes yi budul si yeneen w\u00e0ll yi nu f\u00ebs\u00ebl"], "example_answer": "A", "reasoning": "La question porte sur le principe de la souverainet\u00e9 et l'immunit\u00e9 d'un \u00c9tat dans le contexte du droit international, particuli\u00e8rement sur la notion d'immunit\u00e9 de juridiction (napp) d'un \u00c9tat (r\u00e9ew) face aux actes d'un autre \u00c9tat ou aux tribunaux d\u2019autres \u00c9tats.

In microeconomics, a firm will keep operating in the short run if it can cover its variable costs, even if it incurs some losses, i.e., if the price (P) is greater than or equal to average variable cost (AVC). Another way to put this is comparing the price to marginal cost (MC): typically the firm produces where MR=MC; however, if price falls below MC, it indicates producing is not beneficial. Commonly, when price falls below marginal cost or variable cost, the firm stops production because it's not covering its variable costs. Therefore, the key condition is whether price is less than marginal cost or not.\n\nThe first option states \"the production where MR=MC,\" this is the profit-maximizing output, but does not specify continuation despite losses. The second option \"P < MC\" indicates price less than marginal cost - this usually means no production, so loss-making firm would shut down. The third and fourth options in the local language seem related to effort or shutdown: the third option \"r\u00e9y wujjee kat bu ne soxla xul moroomam\" roughly means \"too much effort without sufficient benefit,\" indicating quitting. The fourth option \"t\u00e0nneefu nj\u00ebg li ci po\u00f1u f\u00e9ewaloo bi\" refers to \"shutting down the firm when it is unprofitable.\" \n\nGiven this, the correct condition relating to continuing to produce in the short run despite losses is option [1], since production at MR=MC is the standard output level even if the firm is making losses but continues under certain conditions.", "pred_answer": "A", "method": 0}, {"question": "nj\u00e0ngum kooo koom ab xam xam bu soxal askan wi la bu", "subject": "high_school_microeconomics", "choices": ["da aju ci lu \u00ebpp si xaalis", "dafa aju rekk si anam yi nuy j\u00ebffandikoo am am gi", "dafa aju rekk si t\u00ebr\u00eblinu xam xam ngir nj\u00e0ngat ko", "dafa soobu lool si yokkuteeg nekkin u xalaat bu rafet"], "example_answer": "B", "reasoning": "The question is asking about the definition or concept of \"nj\u00e0ngum kooo koom ab xam xam bu soxal askan wi la bu\" which in Wolof translates roughly to \"what is the knowledge that truly benefits society\" or \"how knowledge that is social and useful to the people is defined\".\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n[1] \"da aju ci lu \u00ebpp si xaalis\" - it depends mostly on money  \n[2] \"dafa aju rekk si anam yi nuy j\u00ebffandikoo am am gi\" - it depends only on the methods we use to utilize the resources  \n[3] \"dafa aju rekk si t\u00ebr\u00eblinu xam xam ngir nj\u00e0ngat ko\" - it depends only on the transmission of knowledge to learn it  \n[4] \"dafa soobu lool si yokkuteeg nekkin u xalaat bu rafet\" - it depends a lot on increasing welfare with good thoughts\n\nThe question refers to knowledge that serves society socially (useful/social knowledge).

Therefore, the marginal product of the variable input will decline after some point.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\n1. \u00ablu n\u00e9ew si lu n\u00e9ew di leen amdil dafa t\u00e0mbalee w\u00e0cc\u00bb \u2014 Roughly says: \"the more the input, the more the output increases\" implying a constant increase, which is incorrect because of diminishing returns.\n\n2. \u00abm\u00eb\u00f1\u00f1eef yu ligg\u00e9ey  kat di defar dafay w\u00e0\u00f1\u00f1eeku\u00bb \u2014 The \"labour input when doubled leads to doubling\" \u2014 this is referring to constant returns to scale, not diminishing returns in the short run.\n\n3. \u00abme\u00f1\u00f1eef gi yokk ba nu yokke ligg\u00e9ey kat dafa w\u00e0cc\u00bb \u2014 \"Marginal product of labour when we increase labour decreases\" \u2014 reflects that marginal product decreases as labour increases.\n\n4. \u00abme\u00f1\u00f1eef gi yokk ba nu yokk ligg\u00e9ey bi t\u00e0mbalee wacc\u00bb \u2014 \"Marginal product of labour when we increase labour increases\" \u2014 opposite of diminishing returns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 3.", "pred_answer": "C", "method": 0}, {"question": "li ngay bayyi ngir wuti beneen pexe dees koy xamee si turu", "subject": "high_school_microeconomics", "choices": ["am am n\u00e9r\u00e9bu ligg\u00e9ey bi", "suuf", "nj\u00ebgu xaalis bi", "nj\u00ebgu njari\u00f1 li si m\u00ebna aju"], "example_answer": "D", "reasoning": "The question is in Wolof and asks about something that can be used to buy another good but is not itself money.
